          This is my personal website that I use to share my work and a few
          photos from time to time.

          <br /><br />
          I currently work as a Front-End Engineer at AIR MAIL. Alumna of
          University at Buffalo and Texas Southern University. My love for all
          things code began in my early teens, during the Myspace era,
          customizing layouts for myself and friends. I enjoy bridging the gap
          between design and engineering, combining my technical knowledge and
          keen eye for design to create meaningful products.
          <br /><br />
          Aside from coding, I enjoy empowering underrepresented groups in STEM,
          traveling, spending time with loved ones, and photography. I also
          serve on the Leadership Board, as an Evangelist/Advocate for Women Who
          Code DFW.
          <br /><br />
          I seek to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for
          things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out
          the best in me.
